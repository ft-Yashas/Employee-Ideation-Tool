/**
 * Leaderboard service — Node port of the `leaderboard` action in PHP
 * api/users.php. Returns individual rankings, department rankings, and the top
 * ideas, with an optional period filter (monthly | quarterly | yearly | all).
 *
 * The period filter is applied inside the `LEFT JOIN ideas i ON ... <filter>`
 * clause (exactly as PHP), so it constrains which ideas join rather than which
 * users appear — users with no ideas in the period still rank by points.
 *
 * `period` is whitelisted to a fixed SQL fragment (never interpolated from raw
 * input), preserving the PHP behaviour without any injection surface.
