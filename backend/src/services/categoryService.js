/**
 * Idea categories — the list an organisation offers on the submission wizard.
 *
 * These were seven values hard-coded in the frontend bundle and shared by every
 * organisation. They are now rows in each tenant's own database, so a plant that
 * tracks Safety/Quality/Productivity/Delivery/Sustenance and a services org that
 * tracks something else no longer have to agree.
 *
 * Deleting a category does NOT touch the ideas filed under it: ideas.impact_areas
 * stores the chosen names as text, so history keeps reading the way it read on
 * the day it was submitted. Delete means "stop offering this", never "rewrite
 * the past".
