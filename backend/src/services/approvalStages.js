/**
 * Named approval stages — the vocabulary an organisation builds its approval
 * chain from, and the translation of that chain into the reviewer/final role
 * lists the escalation engine already understands.
 *
 * ── Why a stage list and not just two role checkboxes ───────────────────────
 * The chain an organisation describes to its own people is an ORDER —
 * "originator → immediate manager → department manager → plant head" — not two
 * unordered sets of roles. Storing the order is what lets the admin screen add,
 * remove and rearrange the steps, and it is what makes the preview honest.
 *
 * The engine is untouched. `stagesToChain()` derives from the list exactly the
 * two things ideaService asks getApprovalConfig() for:
 *
 *   reviewer_roles  every approver stage except the last — these APPROVE AND
 *                   ESCALATE up the manager tree
 *   final_roles     the last stage — this one CLOSES the idea
 *
 * So the ordering lives here, and reviewAction() keeps walking manager_id
 * upward the way it always has.
 *
 * `originator` is the person who submits. It carries no role and is never an
 * approver; it is in the list so the chain reads top-to-bottom the way an admin
 * would draw it on a whiteboard, and so the first step cannot be mistaken for
 * an approval step.
 */

/**
 * Stage key → the users.role a person must hold to act at that stage.
 *
 * `immediate_manager` maps to plain `manager`: it is the submitter's own line
 * manager, which is a level in the reporting tree rather than a distinct job
 * title. Large organisations keep it; flatter ones delete the stage and ideas
 * go straight to the department manager.
